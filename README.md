I am a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Brigham Young University. In my research group we develop open source tools for designing and testing integrated photonics devices.  Check out some of our open source projects on the [BYUCamachoLab Github Page](https://github.com/BYUCamachoLab).

If you would like to join my research group or collaborate on open source project, please contact me at camacho [at] byu.edu.
